Explaination:

The evaluation function is calculated by using the utility value as following function.
The value of the utility is bigger the better for maxplayer(computer).
The value of the utility is smaller the better for minplayer(user).


If the node ends with maxplayer(computer) and has the minplayer(user) as a parent, utility value will be calculated as follows.
---->utility = 2 * state.humanScore - state.computerScore

If the node ends with minplayer(user) and has the maxplayer(computer) as a parent.
---->utility = 2 * state.computerScore - state.humanScore

In both case, maxplayer and minplayer will be reluctant to choose the node when humanScore gets bigger or computerScore gets smaller and vice versa.

However, in the real code there is a condition statement to verify the player as computer and user.
